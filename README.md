# influence_maximization_BNs

Code to generalize methods (e.g. mean-field approximation) for influence maximization to Boolean networks.

See information_diffusion.ipynb for results on specific genetic regulatory networks (GRNs).
See dynamic_game_theory.ipynb for results on random Boolean networks (RBNs) and the Cell Collective repository (http://cellcollective.org/)

More notebooks and scripts will be added shortly.
