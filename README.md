Influence maximization in Boolean networks
=======================================================

Code to generalize methods (e.g. mean-field approximation) for influence maximization to Boolean networks.

See information_diffusion.ipynb for results on specific genetic regulatory networks (GRNs).
See dynamic_game_theory.ipynb for results on random Boolean networks (RBNs) and the Cell Collective repository (http://cellcollective.org/) [1]

More notebooks and scripts will be added shortly.

The corresponding paper has been submitted for publication.
